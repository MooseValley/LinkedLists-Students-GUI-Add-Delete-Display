# LinkedLists - Students GUI - Add, Delete, Display

Linked Lists – using Java's built-in *LinkedList* class.

## Part 01.

Write a Java class named StudentEmail that has data members for the **name** and **number** of a student. The class should have a **constructor** and appropriate **accessor and mutator** methods. In addition, the **toString** method should include the output information with student name, student number and the corresponding e-mail address. The e-mail address is a string with the student number and @my.email (such as   s123@my.email). Then you write a program that creates a GUI with two labelled text fields, each one for name and student number, a text area to display the information, and four buttons:

•	**Add:**  when the user enters data into the text fields and clicks the ‘add’ button, a StudentEmail object is created and stored in a LinkedList, and in then the student name, number and e-mail is displayed on the text area.

•	**Delete:**  If you want to delete a student e-mail entry, you can enter the student name in the text field and press the ‘delete’ button. If the entered student name doesn’t match any name in the LinkedList, a dialog message box will pop up to indicate this.

•	**Display All:** Clicking ‘display all’ button will display all data (StudentEmail object) that are stored in the linkedlist.

•	**Exit:** Pressing ‘exit’ button will allow users to exit the program.

## Part 02:

•	Add Edit functionality, a application title, center the error dialogs in the applications window, and other improvements.
